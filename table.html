    >Lambda (uppercase Λ, lowercase λ; Greek: λάμ(β)δα lám(b)da) is the 11th
    letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the sound /l/. In the system of
    Greek numerals lambda has a value of 30. Lambda is derived from the
    Phoenician Lamed Lamedh. Lambda gave rise to the Latin L and the Cyrillic El
    (Л). The ancient grammarians and dramatists give evidence to the
    pronunciation as [laːbdaː] (λάβδα) in Classical Greek times.[1] In Modern
    Greek the name of the letter, Λάμδα, is pronounced [lamða]. In early Greek
    alphabets, the shape and orientation of lambda varied.[2] Most variants
    consisted of two straight strokes, one longer than the other, connected at
    their ends. The angle might be in the upper-left, lower-left ("Western"
    alphabets), or top ("Eastern" alphabets). Other variants had a vertical line
    with a horizontal or sloped stroke running to the right. With the general
    adoption of the Ionic alphabet, Greek settled on an angle at the top; the
    Romans put the angle at the lower-left. The HTML 4 character entity
    references for the Greek capital and small letter lambda are &#923; and
    &#955; respectively.[3] The Unicode code points for lambda are U+039B and
    U+03BB.</a
